[PROJECT DESCRIPTION]


**FIX THIS**
Our goal is to make a DJing app that can be used simultaneously across multiple devices. In general, there are very currently very few apps that utilize multiple screens to function.  However, DJ apps would greatly benefit from being shared across multiple screens.  Desktop DJ apps are feature-rich but offer a less intuitive and tactile experience for users. Tablet apps are more ergonomically appropriate for their context but, given constraints in screen space, typically offer a limited subset of features. By modularizing components of a traditional digital or analog DJ setup, we can distribute the interface across a variety of available devices — from handsets to desktops — allowing for both a large number of controls and a tactile and intuitive user experience. Our goal is for the app to be accessible to both novice and experienced users, on multiple devices or only one.
