Deanna:

	* Warm->cool maybe... very personal preference depending on user
	* Desktop track sizes are too big
	* Be able to expand the song when minimized
	* Limit the title  size in settings track buttons
	* Better layout of songs in settings (have buttons be a set width?)
	* Overflow ellipse (CSS property )
	* Having the song title scroll (rather than just cutoff) only for the song playing or on mouseover
	* Clearer visual breaks between Settings button and text below
	* Give it a name
	* Hammer.js  swipe gestures?
	* Functionality lol
	* Have a random generated number to add new device because typing in userID etc. is too long
