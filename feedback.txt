4/23/13 User Studies Feedback

Deanna:

	* Warm->cool maybe... very personal preference depending on user
	* Desktop track sizes are too big
	* Be able to expand the song when minimized
	* Limit the title  size in settings track buttons
	* Better layout of songs in settings (have buttons be a set width?)
	* Overflow ellipse (CSS property )
	* Having the song title scroll maybe (rather than just cutoff) only for the song playing or on mouseover
	* Clearer visual breaks between Settings button and text below
	* Give it a name
	* Hammer.js  swipe gestures?
	* Functionality lol
	* Have a random generated number to add new device because typing in userID etc. is too long

Antonio:

- Auto BPM sync — "very essential"
- Global controls palette should be on largest display

## Have two modes
- Turntable mode
-- Open tracks on different devices
- Auto mode
-- Cycles through set

## Additions to global controls

- Treble / bass
- L/R
- Fader — 'not as smooth as it should be'
- Scratches
- BPM
- BPM display


Changes:

	UI:
		-more neutral color scheme
		-less boxy track views, easier to look at
		-less crowded text 
	Functionality
		-better multi-screen
		
		
	*in general, trying to move towards making this more DJ realistic while maintaining autoplay ability
		to address different user needs
